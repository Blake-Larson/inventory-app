## How It's Made:

### Tech used:

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, SQL, Supabase**

This project demonstrates advanced React architecture and component organization. It was fun to use Next.js to get up and running quickly and benefit from many of the quality of life features it provides. I chose to use an SQL database because it highly resemebles the interface I made on the front-end. This makes it easy to work across the entire stack. Supabase provided an easy way to implement Auth and access to the SQL database.

## Optimizations

- Create additional tables and join them in SQL to work with the relational side of SQL.
- Add a total inventory price row.
- Create a mobile friendly table view.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned how quick and easy SQL can be when working with table-like data. Next.js also allows you spend more time developing the app and less time dealing with things like Auth and Routing.
